# Wireless Snap-On Modular Robot
A wheeled robot with a module slot on the front, allowing module attachments wirelessly through pogo pins.

## Why?
I've been wanting to make this project for a while but never fully commited to it. Now I finally have the opportunity to. The project is inspired by voice assistants on mobile devices, like Siri, but with a physical body and animated face.

## PCB: 
PCB contains power management, motor driver, pogo pins, esp32.
